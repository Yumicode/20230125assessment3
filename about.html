		<h1>About All of Me</h1>

		<p>
			All of me
Why not take all of me?
Can't you see
I'm no good without you?
Take my lips
I wanna lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I get on, dear, without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?
All of me
Why not take all of me?
Can't you see
I'm just a mess without you?
Take my lips
I wanna lose them
Why don't you take my arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I get along without you?
You know that you took a part that used to be my heart
So why not take all of me?
You better get it while you can, baby
I'm leaving town pretty soon now
Yeah, I'm getting out of here
